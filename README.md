## Hi there 👋

### I build things that work. At scale. 🚀

I’m a software engineer who enjoys turning messy ideas into clean, reliable products.
I like systems that don’t break, code that’s easy to trust, and tools that save time.

💡 I focus on:

* Making software **faster**, **simpler**, and **more reliable**
* Automating boring work so humans can do better things
* Building products people actually want to use

---

### What I do 🧠

* Design and ship real-world software
* Improve performance and reduce complexity
* Think long-term, not just quick fixes

I care about **impact**, not just code.

---

### How I work ⚙️

* Clear thinking > clever hacks
* Strong fundamentals > hype
* Ownership mindset
* Bias for action

I like environments where quality and speed both matter.

---

### Outside work 🌍

* Help tech communities grow
* Explore new tools and ideas
* Learn continuously, stay curious

---

### Let’s connect 🤝
